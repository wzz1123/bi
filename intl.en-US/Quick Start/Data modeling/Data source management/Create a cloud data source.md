# Create a cloud data source {#task_wfz_mbq_5db .task}

Data sources must be used as the basis to operate datasets, worksheets, dashboards, data portals, and others. This section describes how to create a cloud data source.

1.   Log on to the Quick BI console. 
2.   Click **Data Sources**. The data source management page is displayed. 
3.   Click **Create** to select a data source. 

## MaxCompute {#task_opx_tbq_5db}

2.   Click **MaxCompute**. 
3.   Enter the required data source connection information, as shown in the following figure. 

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9084/1292_en-US.png)

    -   Name: The name of the data source configuration list.
    -   Database address: There is a default address here, which is generally not subject to modification; if you need to modify, please refer to maxcompute for access to domain names and datacenters.

        **Note:** Database addresses change by region. For example, in the classic network, the database address in HongKong region is http://service.cn-hongkong.maxcompute.aliyun-inc.com/api, the database address in Singapore region is http://service.ap-southeast-1.maxcompute.aliyun-inc.com/api. For more information, refer to: [Access domains and data centers](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/34951.htm).

    -   Project: The name of the project.
    -   Access Id: Access Key ID of the Alibaba Cloud console.
    -   AccessKey: The AccessKey Secret of the Alibaba Cloud console.
    **Note:** The value of AccessKey must be valid. The corresponding account can be that of the project administrator, project owner,  or a common user who has permissions to list, select, and create instances.

4.   Click Connect tests to perform a data source connectivity test. 

    If the connectivity is normal, a prompt message is displayed.

5.   Click **Add**, then the data source is added. 

    After the data source is added, the Data Source tab is automatically displayed, and all data tables under the data source are displayed in the right pane.

    MaxCompute data sources are asynchronously loaded and updated. If it is your first time to create a data source, you must wait one to five minutes for data synchronization.


## MySQL {#task_zs4_5cq_5db}

Due to the limitation of the whitelist policy of ApsaraDB for RDS, you must manually add the following whitelists on the ApsaraDB for RDS console before adding an ApsaraDB for RDS data source: 10.152.69.0/24, 10.152.163.0/24, or 139.224.4.0/24.

To add and set up whiteable lists, see setting up whiteable access domains and data centers.

You can connect to the following ApsaraDB for RDS data source for free.

**Note:** The following information is an example only. Please enter the connection information for the data source based on your actual data source address.

-   Database endpoint: rm-bp180925lcrm7xtc6.mysql.rds.aliyuncs.com
-   Port: 3306
-   Database: bi\_demo
-   User name: bi\_demo
-   Password: bi\_demo

1.   Click **MySQL**. 
2.   Enter the required data source connection information, as shown in the following figure.
