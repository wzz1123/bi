When creating data sources, the Quick BI has the following requirements for the network type of data sources.

1.  The VPC RDS instance can access Quick BI by using an extranet domain name. MySQL and SQL Server instances can access Quick BI by using an intranet domain name, other VPC RDS instances can't access Quick BI by using an intranet domain name.
2.  The instances in the classic network can access Quick BI by using an extranet domain name and an intranet domain name. When you access Quick BI by using an extranet domain name, you should set the IP address whitelist on the RDS.
