Fields in the dataset are automatically classified into **dimensions** and **measurements**. You can edit the dimension and measurement fields based on your table creation requirements. After the dataset is edited, you can save and refresh the edited data using **Toolbar** provided by the system.

## Edit a dimension field {#section_ety_jgr_5db .section}

You can click the operation icon of a dimension field or right-click a dimension field to open the editing menu. For example, if you want to create a bubble or color map, you must set the dimension type to "Geographical Information". Otherwise, you cannot properly make the map.

1.  Select a dimension field,  for example, **order\_level**.
2.  Right-click the selected field. The field editing menu is displayed, as shown in the following figure.

## Toolbar {#section_nk5_rgr_5db .section}

You can use the toolbar shown in the following figure to save, refresh, or synchronize datasets.

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9093/1321_en-US.png)

-   Sync Table Schema: To combine new table fields added to an online physical table. This operation can be used when an online physical table is changed, for example, a field is added. In this case, fields can be easily synchronized online. If a field of the online table is deleted or renamed, the corresponding dimension/measurement of the dataset is not deleted.
-   Refresh Preview: To refresh and preview data of a dataset.  If you want to view the latest data in real time, save the dataset and then refresh data.
-   Save: To save a dataset.
-   Save As: To save the current dataset as a new one. This operation can be used to quickly copy a new dataset or back up a dataset.

## Join tables {#section_gpz_5gr_5db .section}

**Note:** The Multi-Dataset type is not supported.

The following two joining modes are supported.

-   Inner Join
-   Left outer join

If you have two data tables that are from the same dataset, you can click **Join Table** to join one or multiple fields in the second table to the table that is currently edited. The joined table fields are automatically added to the dimension and measurement areas of the first table as folders.

1.  Click the **Join Table** icon. The data table joining page is displayed.
