# Example: Create a dashboard {#concept_i5b_zgp_5db .concept}

This section describes how to use a dashboard to quickly prepare a report. As the example cannot describe all charts, for more information about the basic operations on a dashboard and creation process of each chart, see [Dashboard basic operations](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Dashboard basic operations/Dashboard basic operations.md#) and [Charts overview](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Create charts/Charts overview.md#).

The dashboard supports the following two modes.

-   Standard dashboard
-   Full-Screen mode \(Quick BI pro only\)

## Create a dataset {#section_sx4_3hp_5db .section}

Before creating a dashboard, you must prepare a dataset. As datasets are created using data sources, this section describes how to create a data source first.

This section uses the connection to a MySQL data source as an example to describe how to create a data source.

1.  Log on to the Quick BI console.
2.  Select **Workspace** \> **Data sources** . The data source management page is displayed.
3.  Click **Create \> MySQL \(From Cloud Database\)**. The data source connection menu is displayed.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1233_en-US.png)

4.  Enter the data source connection information and click **Test Connection** to check whether the data source is successfully connected.

    You can use the following MySQL connection address. For more information, see [Example: Create a workbook](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Example: Create a workbook.md#).

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1234_en-US.png)

    If the data source cannot be connected, a corresponding message is returned. You can try to fix this problem by referring to [How to diagnose a data source connection exception](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/54950.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.8.I5jjCh).

5.  Click **Add**. The data source is automatically added to the data source list.
6.  Click the **Create Dataset** icon next to a table, for example, company\_sales\_record, to create a dataset.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1235_en-US.png)


After the dataset is created, it is automatically saved to the **My Dataset** folder. New is displayed for the newly created dataset, which allows you to fast locate the dataset.

## Edit a dataset {#section_rsj_43p_5db .section}

After a dataset is created, you can simply edit the dataset accordingly to meet the actual chart demands, for example, switching the field type or adding a calculated field.

Take company\_sales\_record as an example.

1.  Click **Datasets**. The dataset management page is displayed.
2.  Click a dataset name, for example, company\_sales\_record. The dataset editing page is displayed.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1236_en-US.png)

    To create a map chart, such as a geo bubble or geo map, select dimension fields that contain geographical information, and then switch their field type from String to Geographical Information. Otherwise, the map cannot be displayed.

3.  In the dimension list, select Area.
4.  Right-click the dimension, and select **Change Dimension** \> **Location** \> **Region**. As shown in the following figure.

    **Note:** Note that the selected geographic information must match the field. For example, if the field is Area, you must select Area in the location information list. Otherwise, the field type cannot be switched.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1237_en-US.png)

5.  Switch Province field and City field in the same way.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1238_en-US.png)

6.  After the dataset is edited, click **Save**.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1239_en-US.png)

7.  Select **Synchronize \> Refresh Preview**. The data is automatically displayed in the table.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/9077/1240_en-US.png)
